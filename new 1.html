          	New technology such as smartphones and tablets could be affecting how much sleep people get, a survey suggests.
            <br /><br />
			More than three quarters of those surveyed use devices with screens before going to sleep. The blue light they emit disrupts the body's natural processes.
            <br /><br /> 
            Professor Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire who was behind the survey, says six out of ten people are now getting less than seven hours' sleep a night.

               <div style="font-size: 100%; color:#333; font-family:arial, helmet, sans-serif;"><strong>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, according to the Sleep Council. Michael<br /> Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.</strong></div> 
               <br />
                   It has been known for some time that the amount of sleep people get has, on average, declined over the<br /> years.
                 <br /><br />
				 This has happened for a whole range of reasons, not least because we live in a culture where people are<br /> encouraged to think of sleep as a luxury - something you can easily cut back on. After all, that's what<br /> caffeine is for - to jolt you
                <span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">&nbsp;5</div> 
                back into life. But while the average amount of sleep we are getting has fallen,  
                 <br />
                rates of obesity and diabetes have soared. Could the two be connected?</span>
               <br /><br />
				 We wanted to see what the effect would be of increasing average sleep by just one hour. So we asked<br /> seven volunteers, who normally sleep anywhere between six and nine hours, to be studied at the<br /> University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre.
                <br /><br />
				<span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">10</div></span>
                The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half<br />
                 hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the<br /> 
                volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got<br /> an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.
                <br /><br />
                While we were waiting to see what effect this would have, I went to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford to<br /> 
                <span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">15</div></span>learn more about what actually happens when we sleep.
                <br /><br /> 
				In the Sleep Centre, they fitted me up with a portable electro-encephalograph, a device that measures<br />
                brain wave activity. Then, feeling slightly ridiculous, I went home and had my seven-and-a-half hours<br /> of sleep.
                <br /><br />
				The following day I went to discuss what had happened inside my head during the night with Dr Katharina <br />
                <span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">20</div></span>Wulff.
                <br /><br />
                The first thing she pointed out was that I had very rapidly fallen into a state of deep sleep. Deep sleep<br /> 
                sounds restful, but during it our brains are actually working hard. One of the main things the<br /> 
                brain is doing is moving memories from short-term storage into long-term storage, allowing us more short-<br />
                term memory space for the next day. If you don't get adequate deep sleep then these memories will be<br />
                <span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">25</div></span> lost.
                <br /><br />
				You might think: "I'll cut back during the week and then make up for it at the weekend." Unfortunately it<br /> 
                doesn't work like that, because memories need to be consolidated within 24 hours of being formed.
                <br /><br />
                <img alt="" width="92%" src="files/51217_billede2.jpg" />
                <br /><br />
                Since deep sleep is so important for consolidating memories it is a good idea if you are revising or perhaps
                <br /> taking an exam to make sure that you're getting a reasonable night's sleep. In one study, people who failed 
                <br /><span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">30</div></span>to do so did 40% worse than their contemporaries.
                <br /><br />
				Deep sleep only lasts for a few hours. My electrode results showed that  during the night my brain went<br />
                through multiple phases of another kind of activity, called REM sleep.
                <br /><br />
				"This is the phase when you are usually paralysed - so you can't move," Wulff explained. But the eye<br />
                 muscles are not paralysed, and that's why it's called rapid eye movement sleep."
                <br /><br />
				<span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">35</div></span>During REM sleep an extraordinary thing happens. One of the stress-related chemicals in the brain,
                <br />
               noradrenalin, is switched off. It's the only time, day or night, this happens. It  allows us to remain calm while
               <br /> our brains reprocess all the experiences of the day, helping us come to terms with particularly emotional<br /> events.
                <br /><br /> 
                We get more REM sleep in the last half of the night. Which means that if you are woken unexpectedly,
                <br /><span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">40</div></span> your brain may not have dealt with all your emotions - which could leave you stressed and anxious.
                <br />
                Drinking alcohol late at night is not a good idea as it reduces your REM sleep while it's being processed in
                <br />
                your body. 
                <br /><br />
                Back at the University of Surrey our sleep volunteers had finished their second week of the experiment.<br />
                What we wanted to see was the effect of switching from six-and-a-half hours to seven-and-a-half hours, or<br />
                <span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">45</div></span> vice versa, would have on our volunteers. 
				<br /><br />
                Computer tests revealed that most of them struggled with mental agility tasks when they had less sleep,
                <br /> but the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.
                <br /><br /> 
				Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that<br />
                were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep.
                <br /><br />
				<span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">50</div></span>"We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected," Archer explained. "Some which <br />
                were going up, and some which were going down."
                <br /><br />
				What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours'<br />
                sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response<br />
                to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with<br />              
                <span><div style="font-family:arial; font-size:0.6em; margin-left: -17px; float:left;">55</div></span>
                diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.
                <br /><br />
				So the clear message from this experiment was that if you are getting less than seven hours' sleep a night<br />
                and can alter your sleep habits, even just a little bit, it could make you healthier. "Have a lie-in, it will do<br />
                 you good" - that's the kind of health message that doesn't come along very often.
